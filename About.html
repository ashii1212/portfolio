          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm <strong>Shaik Abdul Ashiq</strong>, a driven and detail-oriented <strong>Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Java Full Stack Developer</strong> currently pursuing my B.Tech in <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> at Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a CGPA of 9.5 and leadership roles as a Class Representative and Project Lead, I bring a strong academic foundation and proven teamwork capabilities. I have interned at <strong>EazyByts Infotech</strong> and <strong>Coursevita</strong>, where I worked on front-end development and Java full stack projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            My portfolio includes diverse projects such as a <strong>Smart Traffic Control System</strong>, <strong>Cricket Protein Extraction Device</strong>, and an <strong>Automated Oil Spill Cleaner using Magnetite and IoT</strong>. These reflect my interest in sustainable innovation, embedded systems, and AI integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also proud to be selected for the <strong>Russia Summer Internship</strong> through the Precise Energy Olympiad and have presented at international conferences, winning a <strong>Best Paper Award</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring agricultural biotechnology, participating in science exhibitions, and sharing knowledge through community programs. My goal is to merge technology with real-world problem-solving to create lasting impact.
          </p>
